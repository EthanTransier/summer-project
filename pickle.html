            <h2>What is Pickleball?</h2>
            <p>Pickleball is a relatively easy sport, however their is always room to improve. This summer I decided that I wasn't good enough, so I practiced with my friends at least twice a week. I would play a lot of games, but I would also practice my serves, my dropshots, and my drives. This lead me to be a better player, and have more fun in the game.</p>
